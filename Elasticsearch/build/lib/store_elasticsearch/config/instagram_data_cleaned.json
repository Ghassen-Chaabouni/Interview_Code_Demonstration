China, Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. It's up to you. guarantee the fulfillment of human rights, help Venezuelans to regain their freedom and democracy, the open and frontal fight against mega criminal organizations and global drug trafficking. The Chinese virus (covi 19) is not a fortuitous case as China declares war on the existence of life in humanity, overwhelmingly with its accomplices, China lied to the world. Me In my opinion, how @jguaido needs the support of the United States. President Real Donal TRUMP has demonstrated with firm determination, his struggles in defense of democracy and life on the planet are nothing ... tremendous responsibility, could well be dedicated to his wife, children and grandchildren, you give yourself body soul and heart in defense of the most precious things on the planet the care and protection of its inhabitants on the planet and in Defense of Democracy. In my opinion, it is time for all the countries of the democratic world to close ranks and all those who feel life as the most sacred of humanity, unite in one voice a single cause. Protecting life on the planet is everyone's job ... \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udf04.
